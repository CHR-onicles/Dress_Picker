#THE_DRESS_PICKER_PROGRAM

Yes, yes I know... dress picker program and you see... I have this problem where I hate picking dresses to wear
I feel its such a trivial task and takes too much of my brainpower...It was on this premise i wrote this program.
I also know its not much but hey, this is legit a program I need that addressed a problem I had so yh suck on that haters ;)

Usage:
Basically enter the number of tops/pants you want
Then enter the names of the attires using underscore as space
Then wait for the magic...the dress is picked at random
