# THE_DRESS_PICKER_PROGRAM

Yes, yes I know... dress picker program and you see... I have this problem where I hate picking dresses to wear
I feel its such a trivial task and takes too much of my brainpower...It was on this premise i wrote this program.
I also know its not much but hey, this is legit a program I need that addressed a problem I had so yh suck on that haters ;)

## Usage:
- Basically enter the number of tops/pants you want
- Enter the names of the attires
- Then wait for the magic...a suggested dress is picked, and at random

### ==>Possible Update:
- Add footwear, and other accessories



### Update Log:
- v2.2: Program accepts just one key to display more results or to end program
	  instead of user typing multiple characters which may spur undesired behaviour from program
- v2.1: Program checks whether user inputs numbers where number of tops and pants are required

- v2.0: Names of dresses can be entered now with spaces; no need for underscores
